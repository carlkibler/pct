- test with some real data
- test + optimize index view (select_related needed probably)
- map improvements:
    - latest location: make it a me icon
    - map initial zoom: way out to see overview? or in to see current points?
    - updates on map:
        - clickable
        - cluster? https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster

BUGS:
- think there's a bug w/inat logic: id_above + identified=true means I'll miss things
 if it's unidentified when fetching an identified object after. so may need different logic there?

MAYBE:
- breadcrumbs: big map display?
