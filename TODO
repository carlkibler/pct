- test with some real data
- test + optimize index view (select_related needed probably)
- map improvements:
    - show the PCT line
        - can I use the whole gpx? or is that too slow?
        - done/not-done would be pretty awesome if possible
    - latest location: make it a me icon
    - is loading the bg image happening even w/map? I think so. if so, remove it? noscript?
    - injecting templates into JS is ugly, switch to xhr
    - show more points on the map?
        - on hover/scroll?
        - how many points is reasonable?
    - map initial zoom: way out to see overview? or in to see current points?

BUGS:
- think there's a bug w/inat logic: id_above + identified=true means I'll miss things
 if it's unidentified when fetching an identified object after. so may need different logic there?

MAYBE:
- breadcrumbs: big map display?
