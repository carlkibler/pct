- test with some real data
- test + optimize index view (select_related needed probably)
- something better with the map display:
    - slippy map plus points?
    - green/red line showing progress?

BUGS:
- think there's a bug w/inat logic: id_above + identified=true means I'll miss things
 if it's unidentified when fetching an identified object after. so may need different logic there?

MAYBE:
- breadcrumbs: big map display?
