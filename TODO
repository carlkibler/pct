- generate a bunch of fake data to make sure everything looks ok
- pagination
- map improvements:
    - updates on map:
        - make clickable
        - better icons?
        - cluster? https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster
- bigger images for inat
- daily stats: look for other types of updates, too. combined_updates(1)?
- collapse Location and Post into a single model?

BUGS:
- think there's a bug w/inat logic: id_above + identified=true means I'll miss things
 if it's unidentified when fetching an identified object after. so may need different logic there?
- I think I might still be rendering the map on mobile?
