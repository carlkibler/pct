- detail view (for just certain types? all of them?)
- test with some real data
- stats: make them stats not just static
- test + optimize index view (select_related needed probably)
- instagram fetching
- something better with the map display:
    - slippy map plus points?
    - green/red line showing progress?
- top nav: make it exist

MAYBE:
- fetch from inaturalist api?
- breadcrumbs: big map display?
