Part of the fun of planning for this trip was picking out some new gear. Most of my backpacking equipment was 10+ years old, and there's been some *massive* improvements in outdoor gear since then. I spent the last couple of years slowly upgrading bit by bit, cutting my pack weight in half in the process. My selection, and the organization of the list below, has been strongly influenced by [Andrew Skurka](https://andrewskurka.com/), particularly his [Backpacking Gear List Template + 3-season Checklist](https://andrewskurka.com/2015/backpacking-gear-list-template-checklist-3-season/). I've made some minor tweaks to better suit the way *I* hike, but if you're looking to learn more about gear Skurka's a far better resource than I am.

As I'm writing this (July 4, 2018), this represents what I plan to start with. I'll make some changes as I go -- ditching warm clothes as the temperatures warm up in Oregon and Northern CA, picking up a bear can in the Sierra, etc. I'll try to update this post with the major changes section-by-section.

#### Summary

- **Base Weight: 12.2 lbs**
- **Total skin-out weight: 16.4 lbs**
- **Estimated average pack weight: ~20 lbs** [^1]
- **Total cost: ~$4,000** [^2]

[^1]: 3 days of food and 1L of water, an average carry.

[^2]: This is a somewhat deceptive number. It includes the cost of some items, like my phone, that aren't hike-specific. While it may overstate the costs of a hike like this, it's not all that wrong. I think it's important to be honest about the costs. Going ultralight is a privilege - check out the cost of that tarp! Being hiker trash *can* be cheap, but often isn't.
